<!--
	Configuration file for model ids and idrefs
	Each <id> element specifies an attribute name which will be treated as an id
	Each <idref> element specifies an attribute name which will be treated as an idref

	Example:

	Under the default configuration consider the following xml model:

	<class name="Customer" extends="BusinessObject">
		...
	</class>
	
	<class name="Invoice">
		<field type="Customer"/>
	</class>

	if $field is the nested element inside the Invoice element, then $field.type is a 
	reference (because the name of the attribute is declared as an idref below) and 
	therefore the expression $field.type.extends will produce the output "BusinessObject"
